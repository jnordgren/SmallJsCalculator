# Small JSCalculator

Tiny project just to freshen up some JS skills,
uses the kinda funny shunting yard algorithm which can quite easily
parse quite complicated strings altough just the basic operators have been implemented here!

## Updates
Added an x function so that the expression "(1/x)*100" will generate a basic plot, plot seems a bit inverted at the moment though
